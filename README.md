# rust_rubiks_cube
This is a Rubik's Cube implemented in Rust.

Code is functional and implements functions for rotation of different faces in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. More functions will be added to assist with usability. 

The cube implemented has faces indexed in the following order:

  |2|\
|4|0|1|\
  |3|\
  |5|\
  
The indexes are chosen to match a standard die face.
