# Rubik's Cube in Rust
This is a 3x3 Rubik's Cube implemented in Rust.

Code is currently working, i.e. it is acheiving its intended function of simulating a Rubik's Cube by allowing one to rotate the faces of the cube in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. More functions will be added in the future to enable a more interactive game.

The cube implemented has faces indexed in the following order:
- Front face: 0
- Left face: 4
- Right face: 1
- Top face: 2
- Bottom face: 3
- Back face: 5 
  
The indexes are chosen to match a standard die face.
