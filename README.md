# rust_rubiks_cube
This is a 3x3 Rubik's Cube implemented in Rust.

Code is functional and implements functions for rotation of different faces in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. More functions will be added to assist with usability. 

The cube implemented has faces indexed in the following order:
- Front face: 0
- Left face: 4
- Right face: 1
- Top face: 2
- Bottom face: 3
- Back face: 5 
  
The indexes are chosen to match a standard die face.
